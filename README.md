TextGenerator
=============

Select a text file (I have included the text of Tom Sawyer as an example) and based on the frequency of words following each other you are able to generate a random string of text that sounds like the original author.

Higher levels of analysis lead to a more in depth and original sounding text file result.

Length is measured in number of characters to be generated.
